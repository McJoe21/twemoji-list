### :memo: Complete list of Twemoji Emojis

Fully updated *(as of 20.10.2020)* list showcasing the proper class names for each and every single **Emoji** from the **Twitter API** (*also known as Twemoji*)

I've spent a total of 50 hours assembling this repo, but it's hopefully going to save someone a few minutes every day :smile:





## Why I took the time to make this list.

Imagine yourself developing a new website, and you need some sweet Emojis! Easy. 
Just go onto an Emoji website and find the desired emoji. You can even use Twitter to find the proper tag for it, just hover! Unless..
