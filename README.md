### :memo: Complete list of Twemoji Emojis

Updated list showcasing the proper class names for each and every single **Emoji** from the **Twitter API** (*also known as Twemoji*)

I've had multiple moments where I've been annoyed over how difficult it is to find a 2020 working Twemoji list, so I spent a few hours assembling a proper list for everyone to use!

##### :thinking: Why? 
This is the Twitter description for :rotating_light: on Twitter:

Here is the same emoji found on [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/police-car-light/), and it shows what it's "*known as*".

### but what's the proper tag for it?
**`rotating-light`**...
I mean, that's a good name, don't get me wrong -  but sure as hell took me some brain cells to figure that out!
